Love live app for final project

TODO:

1. Set up gspread
2. set up OAuth2
    - requires python 3 or above
    - needs pip
IMPORTANT!: Do we need gspread? Android has sqlite built in, perhaps its easier to bypass OAuth2 authentication.
3. plan for Song class
4. set up linked list
5. figure how to populate with gspread
